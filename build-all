Usage: $0 ARCH [PACKAGE TO SKIP]...

Builds all the GTK+ MinGW toolchain, skipping the packages that
have been previously compiled (that is, the directories still
containing a .pkg.tar.xz file).

You must supply the architecture as first argument, e.g. "i686"
for the 32 bits toolchain or "x86_64" for the 64 bits one.

A list of packages to skip can be optionally specified on the
command line. This feature is intended to be used when you want
to build by yourself one ore more packages.
